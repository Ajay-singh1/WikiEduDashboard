title: "AI detection tool"
content: |
  Heads up! Throughout your Wikipedia assignment, we’re using an **AI detection
  tool called Pangram** to check your work on Wikipedia for generative AI output,
  including all exercises.

  Every time the tool detects possible AI text, you and your instructor will
  receive an email. This email will contain a link to tell us more about the situation,
  including whether it was a false positive – when the AI tool incorrectly identifies
  the text as generative AI output.

  If you receive this email alert, please be sure to follow the link and fill out
  the brief report.
